C++ Network Library
===================

:mod:`cpp-netlib` is a library collection that provides application layer
protocol support using modern C++ techniques.  It is light-weight, fast,
portable and is intended to be as easy to configure as possible.

Hello, world!
=============

The :mod:`cpp-netlib` allows developers to write fast, portable
network applications with the minimum of fuss.

An HTTP server-client example can be written in tens of lines of code.
The client is as simple as this:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using namespace boost::network;
    using namespace boost::network::http;

    client::request request_("http://127.0.0.1:8000/");
    request_ << header("Connection", "close");
    client client_;
    client::response response_ = client_.get(request_);
    std::string body_ = body(response_);

And the corresponding server code is listed below:

.. code-block:: cpp

    namespace http = boost::network::http;

    struct handler;
    typedef http::server<handler> http_server;

    struct handler {
        void operator() (http_server::request const &request,
                         http_server::response &response) {
            response = http_server::response::stock_reply(
                http_server::response::ok, "Hello, world!");
        }

        void log(http_server::string_type const &info) {
            std::cerr << "ERROR: " << info << '\n';
        }
    };

    int main(int arg, char * argv[]) {
        handler handler_;
        http_server::options options(handler_);
        http_server server_(
            options.address("0.0.0.0")
                   .port("8000"));
        server_.run();
    }

.. warning:: Be aware that not all features are stable.  The generic
   	     message design is under review and the URI and HTTP
   	     client implementation will continue to undergo
   	     refactoring.  Future versions will include support for
   	     other network protocols.
